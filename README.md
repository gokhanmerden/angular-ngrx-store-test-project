# Angular @ngrx-store sample project
I have created a project using ngrx and shows basic usage of it. I didn't use root state because i preferred split datas into modules. So managing data on module level can be done via less complexity.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
